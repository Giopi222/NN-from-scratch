# NN-from-scratch

In this project, I built a simple neural network (MLP) for a classification problem on the Iris dataset, using mainly NumPy.
The notebook includes the full process with explanations of each step — in particular, the derivation of the backpropagation equations — while the Python file contains the complete implementation.
